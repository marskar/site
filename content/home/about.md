# Biography

Martin Skarzynski, a Cancer Prevention Fellow since 2017, is passionate about Bioinformatics, Data Science and Statistical Computing. Martin uses the Python and R programming languages and command line tools to explore, analyze, visualize and present data and has a strong interest in reproducibility, scientific publishing workflows, and open data/science best practices. Martin is excited to apply his computational skills in combination with his Genomics and Immunology background to the study and prevention of cancer.

Outside of the Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program, Martin is co-chair of the Bioinformatics and Data Science Department at the Foundation for the Advancement of Education in the Sciences (FAES), where he has been an instructor since 2015 and currently teaches Introduction to Python (BIOF309). Martin is also an instructor for Software and Data Carpentry, non-profit organizations that teach computational skills, and an Associate Editor at the journal Frontiers in Public Health.
